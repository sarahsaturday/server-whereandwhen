## Project Overview

The AFG of Middle TN "Where & When" Meeting Directory is a web application developed to streamline the management of local support group meetings for Al-Anon Family Groups (AFG) of Middle Tennessee. The project aims to replace the existing manual system of managing meeting data using Google Sheets with a more efficient and user-friendly database-driven solution.
